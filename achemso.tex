\title[\texttt{achemso} evaluation]
{An evaluation of the CloudLightning simulator}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
Researching and analyzing complex large-scale cloud environments is a challenging task that can be measured only through their simulation. For this reason, the CloudLightning simulation framework was developed as part of the CloudLightning project and funded by the European Commissionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation. The framework, a generalized and extensible simulator that is used to simulate cloud infrastructures, is inherently parallel; it is written in the C++ language using modern C++11 features and employs the OpenMP and MPI APIs to achieve increased scalability. Instead of initializing a set of tasks for execution on the simulated cloud, the simulator uses a time-advancing loop that allows for changes in the status of the system during each time step, rather than between time steps, as with DES type simulations. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the CloudLightning simulator on four axes; the service delivery system, the computational efficiency, the power consumption and the organization and management of resources at scale.

\subsection{Outline}

Aenean consequat turpis eu nunc luctus sollicitudin. Mauris ut est nisl, nec ullamcorper metus. Vivamus vel nisi dolor. Curabitur urna felis, interdum ut adipiscing laoreet, convallis sit amet justo. Sed eleifend, erat ac tincidunt blandit, ipsum quam vestibulum erat, ut mollis neque est varius dui. Vestibulum eu eros risus. Pellentesque in purus at odio dictum condimentum.

\subsection{Floats}

New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
means graphics are included as follows (\ref{sch:example}).  As
illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
\begin{scheme}
  \includegraphics{lion.png}
  \caption{An example graphics}
  \label{sch:example}
\end{scheme}


The example file also loads the \textsf{mhchem} package, so
that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash
\ce\{H2SO4\}} gives \ce{H2SO4}.

The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
not interfere with the production process.  For example,
\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example,
to give italic, monospaced text: \mycommand{some text}.
